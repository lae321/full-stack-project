# Courseology Full-Stack Project

This was the final individual project I completed as part of the _nology 12-week Software Engineering course. The aim was to create a full-stack web app for a fictional company called Courseology which essentially contains a directory of various courses, from Fly Fishing 101, to Quantum Mechanics for Dummies.

The frontend is built with React, while the backend API is built with Java (please see my "courseology-backend" repo for further details). The details of the individual courses are stored on a Google Cloud Platform-hosted MySQL database. You can view further details of a particular course by clicking on its thumbnail. You will then be redirected to a page listing futher details including the courses' price, location and description. Additional courses can be added to the website using the Add a Course feature which utilises a POST request to the the GCP-hosted database.

I found this project very satisfying as it tested all of the skills I had learnt across the course. While the scope of the project is quite small, I encountered a number of challenges a long the way which I enjoyed overcoming. Please see some screen shots of the project below.
